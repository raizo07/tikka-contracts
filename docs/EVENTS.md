# Raffle Contract Events

This document describes all events emitted by the Tikka raffle system, covering both the **Factory** contract (`contracts/raffle/src/events.rs`) and the **Raffle Instance** contract (`contracts/raffle-instance/src/events.rs`). Off-chain indexers, event listeners, and frontend developers use these events to reconstruct complete raffle state without querying contract storage.

## Event Topic Scheme

All events use a consistent two-symbol topic structure:

```
("tikka", "event_name")
```

Where:
- First symbol: `"tikka"` (constant namespace identifier)
- Second symbol: Event name in snake_case matching the struct name (e.g. `ticket_purchased`, `raffle_created`)

# Indexer Implementation Notes

1. **Event Ordering**: Events are emitted in chronological order within each transaction.
2. **Multi-ticket Support**: `ticket_ids` in `TicketPurchased` is a vector supporting batch purchases.
3. **Optional Fields**: Fields typed as `Option<T>` may be `None` — indexer must handle both cases.
4. **Status Transitions**: `RaffleStatusChanged` events accompany most lifecycle events for redundancy.
5. **Timestamps**: All timestamps are Unix seconds from the ledger.
6. **Fee Calculation**: Platform fees are calculated as `(amount * fee_bp) / 10000`.
7. **Randomness Flow**: External randomness requires `RandomnessRequested` → `RandomnessReceived`; on timeout, `RandomnessFallbackTriggered` is emitted instead.
8. **Dead-Code Events**: Events marked as dead code (never emitted in the current implementation) may be activated in future versions — indexers should handle them gracefully.

## Event Emission Guarantees

- Events are only emitted on successful state changes.
- Failed transactions do not emit events.
- Each state-changing function emits exactly one primary event.
- Status changes emit both the primary event and `RaffleStatusChanged`.
- No events are emitted for read-only operations.
