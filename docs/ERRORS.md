# Error Codes Documentation

This document describes all error codes used in the Tikka Raffle contracts. Frontend applications can use these codes to display user-friendly error messages.

## Instance Contract Errors

The instance contract (`Raffle`) handles individual raffle operations. All error codes are defined in the `Error` enum in [`contracts/raffle-instance/src/lib.rs`](contracts/raffle-instance/src/lib.rs).

### General Errors (1-10)

  return (

      <span className="error-icon">⚠️</span>
      <span>{message}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Testing Error Handling

All error codes should be tested in the contract test suite to ensure proper error propagation. Run tests with:

```bash
cd contracts/raffle
cargo test
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always use Result types**: Never use `panic!()` or `expect()` in production code
2. **Provide meaningful error codes**: Use descriptive error codes that frontend can map to user messages
3. **Document all errors**: Keep this file updated with any new error codes
4. **Handle edge cases**: Test all error paths to ensure proper error propagation
5. **Use appropriate error granularity**: Different errors should have different codes for better UX
